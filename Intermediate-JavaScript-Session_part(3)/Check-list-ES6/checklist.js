/* 
1. Let const 
2. Template string
3. use variable
4. use object property
5. arrow function
6. arrow function with one parameter. will return the number afteer dividing by 5
7. with two parameters. will add two to each number and then multiply the result
8. three parameters. will multiply all three parameters
9. with two parameters byt it will be multilive arrow function. will add two to each number and then multiply then make sure you return the result 
10.. extra work [function declaration vs arrow function]
11. array of numbers. and then map the get each elements multiplied by 5. must use arrow function
12. [challenging ]numbers of array. get odd numbers filter with arrow function
13. [challenging] array of object (e.g. products). use find to get the object with price 5000.
14. You have an object. Now  use destructing for a simple object.
15. You have an array. Now  use destructing for a simple array.
16. [challenging] You have an array. Now  use destructing to create a simple (or more) variable to get the third element of the array in a variable called 'three. 
17. [optional] just a write a function with three parameters and the last parameter will have a default parameter with value 7. this functin will take three parameters and will return the sum of all the three parameters.
